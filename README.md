Analyzing historic NASDAQ data and exploring investment strategies

Original Source data is NASDAQ_100.csv and was downloaded from kaggle.

I created a multitude of features for modelling and analysis which can be found in the NASDAQ-modelling.csv and NASDAQ-modelling-advanced-features.csv

The various Jupyter scripts can be viewed in any order.
